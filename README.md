# type-script-playground
This is a collection of work I have done using the TypeScript language.

TypeScript compiler is installed using NPM through command 'npm install -g typescript'.  
Files are compiled using command 'tsc file-name.ts'. (TypeScript file)  
Files are run using command 'node file-name.js'. (JavaScript file)  
  
**NOTE**  
Complie .ts files but run .js files. Files are compiled down to javascript, and must be run as javascript.
